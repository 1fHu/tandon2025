Deductions:
-1: did not get rid of newline after the int is read (debug program to see that index 0 contains "")
-1 missing function prototypes
-2 incorrect test for capitalization should not be using the function isupper()

Warnings:
- ensure that comments on function definitions include (1. Description, 2. Parameters, 3. Return Type)
